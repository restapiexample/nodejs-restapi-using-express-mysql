# Nodejs REST API example using ExpressJS and MySQL

I wrote a simple example of a RESTFul API with CRUD operation using MySQL database. 

With this example you can:

* Add record
* Edit record
* Delete record
* Fetch one or all records

# How to create a database and table in MySQL
In the MySQL query editor write and execute the following command:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE test;
```
Then execute the __customer.sql__ script.

# How to run the example
Clone the repo
```BASH
git clone https://github.com/restapiexample/nodejs-restapi-using-express-mysql.git
```

Then run
```
npm install
```

```
node index.js
```

## Happy Coding! :smile:
